# Meetchu
An app for study groups.

## Problem Statement
College courses are difficult and many students choose to form study groups. However, forming and managing a study group can be a hassle. Students have to juggle multiple applications, including messaging apps for communication and calendar/scheduling apps for planning meetings. There exists no centralized application designed specifically for student group study. Our product combines the best features from messaging and scheduling applications to provide the definitive group studying application for Purdue students.
